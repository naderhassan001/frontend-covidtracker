<h1 align="center">COVID Tracker</h1>

<p align="center">
This project is a homemade COVID projector. Its very simple, using only one script and no CSS. The program simulates the spread of COVID. Each ball interacts with
eachother and changes color based on interaction. The pool starts off with 1000 balls. This program represents a population
  and then once a virus is added to the system it slowly spreads whenever a ball
  with covid comes in contact with a ball that has covid. After a collision a balls immunity 
  is increased but there is also a probability they could get sick or die. Once immunity reaches a
  threshold you can nolonger get sick but you can still spread the virus.
